/*
 * Clarification: Check Points (and commits)
 * IndexWriter writes new index files to the directory without writing a new segments_N
 * file which references these new files. It also means that the state of 
 * the in memory SegmentInfos object is different than the most recent
 * segments_N file written to the directory.
 * Each time the SegmentInfos is changed, and matches the (possibly 
 * modified) directory files, we have a new "check point". 
 * If the modified/new SegmentInfos is written to disk - as a new 
 * (generation of) segments_N file - this check point is also an 
 * IndexCommit.
 * A new checkpoint always replaces the previous checkpoint and 
 * becomes the new "front" of the index. This allows the IndexFileDeleter 
 * to delete files that are referenced only by stale checkpoints.
 * (files that were created since the last commit, but are no longer
 * referenced by the "front" of the index). For this, IndexFileDeleter 
 * keeps track of the last non commit checkpoint.
